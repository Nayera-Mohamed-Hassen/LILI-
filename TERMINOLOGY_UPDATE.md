# Terminology Update: Expense Goals â†’ Spending Limits

This document outlines the terminology changes made to clarify that expense goals are spending limits for specific categories, not income targets.

## Problem Identified

The user clarified that when setting a "goal" in the expenses page, they want to set a spending limit for a category (e.g., don't exceed $500 on groceries this month), not a total income target. The previous terminology was confusing and could be misinterpreted.
