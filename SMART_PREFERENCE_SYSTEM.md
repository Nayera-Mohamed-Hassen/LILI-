# Smart User Preference System

## Overview

The Smart User Preference System automatically learns and updates user preferences when recipes are cooked. This system makes recipe recommendations more personalized and intelligent over time. **User preferences now directly affect recipe recommendations**, making them more relevant to individual users.

## Features

### ðŸ§  Smart Preference Learning
- **Ingredient Preferences**: Tracks which ingredients users prefer based on cooking history
- **Meal Type Preferences**: Learns preferred meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.)
- **Cooking Time Preferences**: Understands user's preferred cooking time ranges
- **Ingredient Combinations**: Tracks frequently used ingredient pairs and combinations

### ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent Boosting System
- **Complexity Boost**: Complex recipes (more ingredients) get higher preference boosts
- **Main Ingredient Boost**: First 3 ingredients in a recipe get higher boosts
- **Protein Boost**: Protein-rich ingredients get additional preference weight
- **Fresh Ingredient Boost**: Fresh vegetables and herbs get preference boosts
- **Diminishing Returns**: Prevents preferences from becoming too extreme

### ðŸ“Š Preference Analysis
- **Preference Scoring**: Calculates preference match scores for new recipes
- **Combination Analysis**: Identifies frequently used ingredient combinations
- **Cooking History**: Maintains detailed cooking session history
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracks preference changes over time

### ðŸŽ¯ **Recipe Recommendation Integration**
- **Personalized Rankings**: Recipe recommendations now consider user preferences
- **Preference Weighting**: 40% preference score + 60% base recipe score
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Ingredient preferences (60%), meal types (20%), cooking times (20%)
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Recommendations improve as users cook more recipes

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. `update_preferences_on_cook()` Function
**Location**: `backEnd/app/recipeAI.py`

**Parameters**:
- `user_id`: User's unique identifier
- `recipe_ingredients`: List of ingredients used in the recipe
- `recipe_name`: Name of the recipe (for logging)
- `meal_type`: Type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.)
- `cooking_time`: Time taken to cook the recipe

**Smart Features**:
- Ingredient cleaning and standardization
- Multi-factor preference boosting
- Meal type and cooking time tracking
- Ingredient combination analysis
- Cooking history logging

#### 2. `get_user_preferences()` Function
**Location**: `backEnd/app/recipeAI.py`

**Returns**: Complete user preference data including:
- Ingredient preferences with scores (1-10)
- Meal type preferences
- Cooking time preferences
- Ingredient combinations
- Cooking history

#### 3. `calculate_preference_boost()` Function
**Location**: `backEnd/app/recipeAI.py`

**Purpose**: Calculate preference match score for recipe recommendations

**Returns**: Float (0.0-1.0) representing preference match strength

#### 4. **Enhanced `get_recipe_recommendations()` Function**
**Location**: `backEnd/app/recipeAI.py`

**New Features**:

**Scoring Algorithm**:
```
Final Score = (0.6 Ã— Base Recipe Score) + (0.4 Ã— Preference Score)
Preference Score = (0.6 Ã— Ingredient Match) + (0.2 Ã— Meal Type Match) + (0.2 Ã— Cooking Time Match)
```

### API Endpoints

    "preferences": {
      "chicken": 4.2,

## Smart Boosting Algorithm

### Ingredient Preference Boost Calculation
```
Base Boost = 1.0
Complexity Boost = min(ingredients_count / 5, 2.0)
Main Ingredient Boost = 1.5 (if ingredient is in first 3) else 1.0
Protein Boost = 1.3 (if ingredient contains protein) else 1.0
Fresh Boost = 1.2 (if ingredient is fresh) else 1.0

Total Boost = Base Ã— Complexity Ã— Main Ã— Protein Ã— Fresh
New Preference = min(Current + Total Boost, 10.0)
```

### Preference Match Score Calculation
```
Ingredient Score = average(preference_scores) / 10.0
Combination Score = min(combination_count / 10.0, 0.5)
Total Score = min(Ingredient + Combination, 1.0)
```

### **Recipe Recommendation Scoring**
```
Base Recipe Score = (0.4 Ã— Complexity) + (0.6 Ã— Coverage)
Preference Score = (0.6 Ã— Ingredient Match) + (0.2 Ã— Meal Type Match) + (0.2 Ã— Cooking Time Match)
Final Score = (0.6 Ã— Base Recipe Score) + (0.4 Ã— Preference Score)
```
