### 2. Test the functionality:

```bash
cd backEnd
python test_expense_goals.py
```

## Data Structure

### Expense Goal Model:
```dart
class ExpenseGoal {
  final String id;
  final String userId;
  final String category;
  final double targetAmount;
  final double currentAmount;
  final String period; // weekly, monthly, yearly
  final DateTime startDate;
  final DateTime endDate;
  final bool isActive;
}
```

      "is_active": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Database Collections

The expense goals are stored in MongoDB in the `expenseGoals` collection with the following structure:

  "user_id": "string",
  "category": "string",
  "target_amount": number,
  "current_amount": number,
  "period": "string",
  "start_date": "string",
  "end_date": "string",
  "is_active": boolean,
  "created_at": "string",
  "updated_at": "string"
}
```

## Visual Indicators

## Error Handling

The app includes comprehensive error handling for:

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the expense goals feature:

- **Goal Templates**: Predefined goal suggestions
- **Goal Sharing**: Share goals with household members
- **Goal History**: Track goal performance over time
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered goal recommendations
- **Goal Categories**: Group goals by priority or type

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Goals not updating**: Ensure the backend server is running
2. **Progress not calculating**: Check that expenses are being added with correct categories
3. **Goals not appearing**: Verify user authentication and data loading
4. **API errors**: Check network connectivity and server status

### Testing:

Run the test script to verify all functionality:
```bash
cd backEnd
python test_expense_goals.py
```

## Integration with Existing Features

The expense goals feature integrates seamlessly with:
- **Transaction tracking**: Automatically calculates progress from expenses
- **Category system**: Uses existing expense categories
- **User authentication**: Tied to individual user accounts
- **Household system**: Can be extended for household-wide goals

This feature helps users better manage their spending by setting clear targets and tracking their progress in real-time!
